# 🌊 StreamFlow - Distributed Notification Engine

StreamFlow is a fault-tolerant, asynchronous notification system designed for high throughput and reliability. It utilizes **Apache Kafka** for decoupled event streaming, **MongoDB** for persistent logging, and implements a robust **Resilience Strategy** using Exponential Backoff and Dead Letter Queues (DLQ) to ensure zero data loss.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Core:** Java 17, Spring Boot 3.4
- **Messaging:** Apache Kafka (with Zookeeper)
- **Database:** MongoDB (NoSQL Persistence)
- **Resilience:** Spring Retry (Exponential Backoff policies)
- **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose
- **Documentation:** OpenAPI (Swagger UI)

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system decouples producers and consumers to handle massive traffic spikes gracefully without crashing downstream services.

    end

### Key Features

1.  **Event-Driven:** Fully asynchronous communication prevents blocking the main API thread.
2.  **Resilience (Circuit Breaker Logic):**
      * **Transient Failures:** If the consumer encounters a network blip, it retries **3 times** with **Exponential Backoff** (1s wait, then 2s wait).
      * **Permanent Failures:** If all retries fail, the message is **not lost**. It is automatically moved to a **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** (`notifications-dlq`) for later inspection.
3.  **Zero Data Loss:** Critical notifications are never dropped, ensuring 100% reliability for business-critical alerts.

## 🛠️ How to Run

### 1\. Start Infrastructure

Make sure Docker Desktop is running, then spin up Kafka, Zookeeper, and MongoDB:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 2\. Run the Application

Navigate to the project folder and start the Spring Boot app:

```bash
cd core/core
./mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

### 3\. Explore the API

Once the server is running, access the interactive API documentation:

## 🧪 Fault Tolerance Proof (The "Crash Test")

We simulated a system failure by sending a "poison pill" message (`error`) to the system. The logs demonstrate the **Exponential Backoff** and **DLQ Fallback** mechanisms kicking in to protect data integrity.

### Scenario:

1.  **User** sends a notification with the message text `"error"`.
2.  **Consumer** detects the error and throws an exception.
3.  **Spring Retry** attempts to process it 3 times with increasing delays.
4.  **Recovery:** After the 3rd failure, the system captures the event and routes it to the `notifications-dlq` topic.

### Console Output Evidence:

```text
🔄 Processing Attempt: error
... (1 second wait) ...
🔄 Processing Attempt: error
... (2 second wait) ...
🔄 Processing Attempt: error
❌ All Retries Failed. Moving to DLQ...
⚠️ DLQ Received Bad Message: FAILED: error
```
